# [Bare](https://github.com/srsgores/bare)

Start your next project with only the bare essentials.  No javascript, offline-first, and less cruft.

It's back to the basics: just HTML5 and CSS.  The web needs more of this, and less javascript.

## Usage

Clone the git repo to your new project directory:

``git clone https://github.com/srsgores/bare.git``

## Features

* No JS out of the box
* No build tools needed
* HTML5-optimized
* Responsive viewport meta
* Touch icons and config files for various browsers
* Offline-ready via appcache
* Style-agnostic

## Updating favicon

Just replace what's already here after downloading yours from [favicon generator](http://www.favicon-generator.org/)


## Updating Offline Version

Update the ``created`` date in the ``manifest.appcache``

## Contributing

I will welcome any ideas on how to **reduce** bloat.  If there is a way, let's make this happen.
